# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

RecipeWiz

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you search for food items/leftover ingredients to find new recipes to cook.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TOur porject is a food recipe generator that takes the users input (food item or ingredient) from a text box and search button, then outputs a selection of randomly generated foods according to the input. We will first import specific modules like flask and requests. The program will consist of multiple functions that will allow the program to read a food/recipe database through a Food and Recipe API, and using the request function to retreive the desired information from the API. We plan to use the Flask framework to create our website with Python, design it with HTML and CSS, and then host our website with PythonAnywhere.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Gain experience with programming real applications in different languages
- Feature it on resume
- Talk about in interview


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Succesfully create an interactive, recipe generator website that runs properly and smoothly


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

As beginner programmer in CIS 1051, we only know python as of right now. However, we plan to research and learn HTML and CSS as well to 
fully craete our website. We will be using HTML to create the content of the page like headings, and CSS to design the colors, fonts, etc. Along with this, we will have to install and understand the Flask framework and set up a virutal environment to connect our Python backend to our frontend with HTML and CSS. We will learn to use PythonAnywhere to host our flask application. We will research using platforms like Stack Overflow, GitHub, Reddit, and Youtube. 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
